# JavaScript_Intro
This branch comprises of my project practice using the basics of javascript to build a simple black jack game.

Recap Includes:
  -Using Arrays
    -push is used to append an element to an array
    -pop is used to remove an element from an array
    -The concept of indexing is pretty similar to python and java
      -index starts from 0
      -It has .length method to reference the length of an array
  -Using Objects
    -This concept is unique because it introduces key-value pairs
    -JSON Object
    -Note that you can represent a function name as a key and write the actual function in the value. To call this function
      call the function name and add a parenthesis
     -You can use both dot notation and square brackets to reference the value of a key
  -Using Conditions
    -With Comparison Operators
    -With Logical Operators
    -With Boolean
   -Using Loops
   -Using Math Object
    -Utilized math.floor and math.ceiling to create random values
   -Using return statement in a function
   
   
   Note to self: The start Button can be improved upon. You only want the start button to actually start the game. It should be disabled if a game is in progress
